You can use the money to buy coding books off Amazon. Also, a lot of resources are free.

I'm going to leave you a copy-pasted answer I give people of resources to learn, I leave these resources for aspiring junior developers:

FreeCodeCamp:

https://www.freecodecamp.org/

https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp

GitHub free CS education:

https://github.com/ossu/computer-science

Also, try to learn the stuff in this roadmap:

https://roadmap.sh/full-stack

After that you can continue with the frontend or backend roadmap on:

https://roadmap.sh/

Oh, and to get started you can take this free Harvard CS-50 Course:

https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science

There's a list of university Computer Science courses at:

https://cse.engin.umich.edu/academics/course-resources/cse-course-info/

For each of those courses you can find the syllabus online (maybe click the link for the course or Google search "UMich" + Course Name + syllabus). The textbook for the course is in the syllabus. You can use your stipend to buy used versions of the textbooks.

To learn the command line and the command line tool git, here is a missing semester of Computer Science education:

https://missing.csail.mit.edu/

Once you've gone through that stuff and have a nice GitHub with pinned repositories and a nice LinkedIn with a filled out projects section, here is how you study for the coding exam to get a computer programming job:

Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle McDowell is a great review book before the interview but it's not the best to learn things for the first time.
